**Description:**
This repository contains the codebase for desired application. The backend is built with Express.js, fetches data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` API and serves it to the frontend via the route `/api/data`. The frontend is developed in React.js, showcases the retrieved user data with an intuitive UI. It employs Redux for state management and implements custom pagination to efficiently display user information as a list.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new Express.js project.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including React.js, Redux, and Axios.
3. Create a new React.js project.
4. Create a route in Express.js to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API.
5. Create a component in React.js to display the API data of the user.
6. Use Redux to manage the state of the application.
7. Create a custom pagination component in React.js to show the user data as a list.
8. Connect the backend and frontend together.
9. Start the application and test it.

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
3. Start the backend server by running `npm start`.
4. Move to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
5. Launch the frontend by running `npm start`.
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
